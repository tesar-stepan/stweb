Travel, explore or adventure. My approach to travel is to experience
a place to it's fullest, and genuinely meet the people there, by living with them.
This is why most of my trips end up taking months or even years.</p><p>Below is a selection of videos and pictures from some of my past trips, starting with the most recent one.</p><p><i>Please do not distribute any images or videos on this website without my express authorization.</i></p></div><p></p><h2>Canada</h2><p>I am currently in the Yukon Territory, Canada. I lived in Vancouver prior to this trip, and this is
still an adventure in progress. Here are some pictures from the journey North.
</p><p>I am documenting this trip in more detail on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hodne.jsem.nekde/">Instagram</a>,
and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jsem.nekde">Facebook</a>. These channels are, however, mainly focused on a Czech
speaking audience.</p><div class="row"><a href="images/travel/yt1.jpg"><img src="images/travel/yt1.jpg" title="Kayaking in Squamish"/></a><a href="images/travel/yt2.jpg"><img src="images/travel/yt2.jpg" title="Kayaking in Pitt Meadows"/></a><a href="images/travel/yt3.jpg"><img src="images/travel/yt3.jpg" title="Hope Slide"/></a></div><div class="row"><a href="images/art/photos/33.jpg"><img src="images/art/photos/33.jpg" title="Sunset near Fort Nelson"/></a><a href="images/travel/yt4.jpg"><img src="images/travel/yt4.jpg" title="Aurora Borealis near Fort Nelson"/></a><a href="images/travel/yt5.jpg"><img src="images/travel/yt5.jpg" title="Snowed in near Whitehorse"/></a></div><h3>Van Build</h3><p>I spent 4 years in Vancouver, working and taking a break after traveling in Europe. Last 2 years a lot of
my free time was spent on fixing and camperizing a 1988 Volkwagen Transporter (called 'Vanagon' in the North American
market). This was a challenging project, and it would have been impossible to pull off without support
some amazing people in the Vancouver, and the global, Vanagon and VW community.

During my time there, I was
able to venture into the great outdoors around the Lower Mainland, and parts of the
USA west coast, to climb, ski, tour and claim few mountain summits.

the best way of moving around a big urban center like Vancouver proved to be a motorcycle
(At least in the summer months). I have managed to put my tinkering needs to good use modifying
a 1982 Honda CB650 into a Cafe Racer. I have later switched to an even older Suzuki GS550,
that has already been fully modded, but needed a lot of TLC.

Morocco to Greece. I have never sailed before, but going through few storms quickly taught me how to
handle the rudder and sails. During the voyage there were many opportunities to explore Mallorca,
Sardinia, Sicily and Corfu. After arriving in Greece, I spent a bit of time in Albania, and then
hitchhiked most of the way back home to the Czech Republic.

My english has since improved enough to notice many mistakes, but I decided to keep the
original wording.
